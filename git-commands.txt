The are numerous Git Commands to learn as follows:

Git init - Initialize a Git (Only Required once per project)

Git add <file(s)> - Stage code changes (for the next commit)
Git commit -m “...” - Create a commit for the staged changes (with a message)

Git status - Get the current repository status (e.g. which changes are staged)

Git log - Output a chronologically ordered list of commits

Git checkout <id> - Temporarily move back to commit <id>

Git revert <id> - Revert the changes of commit <id> (by creating a new commit)

Git reset <id> - Undo commit(s) up to commit <id> by deleting commits

Please can you review this code if there are anymore commands to add?
